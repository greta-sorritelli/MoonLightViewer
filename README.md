<h1> MoonlightViewer</h1>
<h2> Authors: Albanese Clarissa, Sorritelli Greta</h2>

Project for the realization of a graphic environment to support space-time properties monitoring
of Cyber-physical systems.

The goal of the project is to create a graphical interface for the MoonLight tool,
to support the user in understanding the data of the analysis performed.

It allows visualizing cyber-physical systems through dynamic and static graphs.
It allows to view the data collected through graphs:
- piecewise linear graph with linear axis
- piecewise linear graph with logarithmic axis
- stepwise constant graph


Graph creation using .tra files. <br>
Chart creation and positioning of graph nodes using .csv files.
